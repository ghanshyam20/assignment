"""
Findings:
- The optimal alpha for Ridge regression is approximately {optimal_ridge_alpha}, with an R2 score of {optimal_ridge_r2}.
- The optimal alpha for LASSO regression is approximately {optimal_lasso_alpha}, with an R2 score of {optimal_lasso_r2}.
- Ridge regression tends to perform better than LASSO for this dataset, as indicated by the higher R2 scores across most alpha values.
- The R2 score for both models decreases as alpha becomes too large, indicating over-regularization.
- The plot shows that Ridge regression is less sensitive to the choice of alpha compared to LASSO.
